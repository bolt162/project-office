Tools Used: MySQL Command Line, PHP 7, HTML.

Process of Data Loading: We used the LOAD INFILE LOCAL command to load the data from the text files to the sql server, used the TERMINATE BY command to differentiate each attributes. Also, we used the ENCLOSED BY command to avoid the single quotation around the strings.

How to run:

Open the folder inside terminal

php -S (ip address):(port)

Go to the web browser.
Enter the following in the address bar:

https://(ip address):(port)/create.php
then,
https://(ip address):(port)/form.html

where (ip address) is your local ip address, and (port) is the port number.
